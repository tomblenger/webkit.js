This test verifies that we don't assert when we generate the computed style for an element that meets the following conditions:
(1) The element has a custom filter containing a transform parameter.
(2) The element does not have a CSS box. For example, the element is display: inline.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS element is non-null.
PASS Computing the filter style for the element did not crash the browser.
PASS filterPropertyCSSValue is non-null.
PASS successfullyParsed is true
